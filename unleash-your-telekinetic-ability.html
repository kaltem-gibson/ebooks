	<p>In this foundational text, I, <b>Kaltem M. Gibson</b> strip away the mysticism surrounding telekinesis to reveal a systematic methodology for influencing objects mentally. I define telekinesis simply as the <b>ability to influence an object mentally</b>. I posit that reality is divided into the <b>physical plane</b> (everything outside the mind) and the <b>mental plane</b> (the internal processing of thought and emotion).</p>

	<p>The core of my methodology rests on the <b>Three Fundamentals of Telekinesis</b>, which I instruct to be practiced in a specific sequence: <b>Focus</b> (centered at the brow chakra), <b>Energy</b> (centered at the crown chakra), and <b>Force</b> (also anchored at the crown). By mastering these, you learn to bridge the gap between internal will and external matter.</p>

	<h2>The Three Fundamentals of Telekinesis</h2>

	<p>Success in telekinesis is not achieved through physical strength, but through the mastery of three mental frequencies as I have outlined:</p>

	<p><b>Focus (Fundamental I):</b> I define this strictly as "no thought loudness". Unlike traditional concentration, true focus occurs when you silence internal thought echoes at the brow chakra.</p>

	<p><b>Energy (Fundamental II):</b> I define this as "matter in its pure form". This fundamental is associated with the crown chakra and represents your internal sensation and production of PSI energy.</p>

	<p><b>Force (Fundamental III):</b> The final execution stage, which I locate at the crown chakra. I guide the application of Force through three secondary components: <b>Sight, Emotion, and Tension</b>.</p>

	<h2>Energetic Safety and Aura Quality</h2>

	<p>I emphasize that telekinesis cannot be safely or effectively practiced while in a "bad aura" state. In my findings, I provide specific markers for determining your energetic suitability:</p>

	<p><b>Determining a Good Aura:</b> I encourage practice only if you possess a calm mind, peaceful environment, and lack of physical tension or reliance on mind-altering substances.</p>

	<p><b>The Warning Signs:</b> I have identified indicators of a negative state which include "thought loudness," recurring nightmares, ringing in the left ear, and unexplained physical discomforts like stabbing pains or migraines.</p>

	<p><b>The Environmental Limitation:</b> A critical discovery I present in this volume is the "Wind Theory," which I demonstrate through the sealed jar experiment. I prove that telekinesis cannot influence matter in an environment completely devoid of internal energy in motion, reinforcing my principle that mind and environment must act as a single, harmonious system.</p>

	<p>I present my methodology as a positive discipline, intended to uplift humanity through mental clarity and inner peace.</p>
