	<p>I present a summary of my groundbreaking work that advances a detailed <b>Unified Field Theory</b> (UFT) formulated through the precise lens of <b>plane geometry</b>, proportional arithmetic, and rigorously reproducible measurements. My book argues that all of reality—from the macro-scale of planetary orbits to the micro-scale of biological defects—is governed by a unified principle where <b>force manifests as geometry itself</b>, using numerical values as the primary tool to identify and characterize the underlying structural positions within a cycle.</p>

	<h2>The Four Volumes of the Framework</h2>
	
	<p>Hexagram Force unites four books into a single framework aimed at solving fundamental scientific questions:</p>

	<div class="book-section">
	
		<span class="book-title">Nog</span>
		
		<p>Explores force as a structured phenomenon expressed through geometry, magnetism, and natural patterns. It studies ancient sites (Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc) as evidence of advanced knowledge of force distribution. This section also lays the groundwork for a unified field theory connecting gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear interactions.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="book-section">
	
		<span class="book-title">Quark</span>
		
		<p>Demonstrates that planetary formation is not random but follows precise mathematical laws. Through repeated calculations, it shows correlations between tilt, size, and magnetic fields, offering proof of intentional design. It reexamines Einstein’s unfinished unified field theory, reveals hexagram configurations on gas giants, and connects astrological structures with planetary science.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="book-section">
	
		<span class="book-title">Rom</span>
		
		<p>Challenges established constants, including reevaluating π as 3.15, and develops frameworks based on sacred geometry and biblical numerology. It interprets symbolic numbers such as 333 and 666 as force indicators, examines dark matter and dark energy, and highlights recurring constants such as 19.5° and 22.5° that appear across astronomy, ancient architecture, and natural cycles.</p>
		
	</div>

	<div class="book-section">
	
		<span class="book-title">Ishka</span>
		
		<p>Extends the theory into human anatomy, showing that the body itself is constructed according to geometric laws and force principles. Joints, muscles, and the brain’s orientation all follow proportional systems described by the One-Third Theory and bi-directional doubling and halving theory, proving that living systems embody the same universal structures as the cosmos.</p>
		
	</div>

	<p>Together, these volumes argue for a <b>unified vision of force based on unique theories</b>: one that redefines planetary science, offers solutions to the unified field theory and reveals a geometric order connecting the universe, the phenomena, and the human body.</p>

	<div class="data-callout">
	
		<b>The One-Third Theory:</b> Force organizes itself through recurring one-third relationships and a predictable family of fractional degrees: <b>22.5°, 7.5°, 2.25°, and 0.75°</b>. These numbers encode the flow of energy in nature.
		
	</div>

	<h2>I. Celestial & Mathematical Breakthroughs</h2>
	
	<h3>High-Precision Mercury Derivation</h3>
	
	<p>The author presents a calculation for <b>Mercury’s rotation</b> that matches observed behavior with an exceptionally small margin of error:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Observed Rotation:</b> 0.034°</li>
		<li><b>Geometric Result:</b> 0.03429°</li>
		<li><b>Variance:</b> Approximately <b>0.0003 degrees</b></li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Re-evaluation of Pi (&pi;)</h3>
	
	<p>The author formally challenges the traditional value of pi (&pi;), arguing it should be precisely <b>3.15</b>. This value is derived through plane geometry and proven theories demonstrating geometric <b>hexagram symmetry</b>.</p>

	<h3>Solar System Geometry</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>The Asteroid Belt:</b> In this book, you will learn that the asteroid belt is not the result of a random collision, but is instead a specific force location—a structured boundary with a natural midpoint near <b>300 million km</b>.
		</li>
		<li><b>Uranus:</b> A <b>"controlled exception,"</b> where axial tilt and magnetic displacement are offset by predictable one-third values.</li>
		<li><b>Magnetic Signatures:</b> The theory explains recurring 7.5° and 22.5° values in magnetic tilts and storm features across the solar system.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>II. Terrestrial, Biological & Temporal Evidence</h2>

	<h3>Ancient Alignment & Geophysical Anomalies</h3>
	
	<p>The positions of the <b>Giza Pyramids, Stonehenge, and Easter Island</b> resolve repeatedly to precise one-third degree values. Furthermore, the <b>Bermuda Triangle</b> and the <b>South Atlantic Anomaly</b> are shown to differ by roughly <b>22.5°</b>.</p>

	<h3>Biological Hexagram Geometry</h3>
	
	<p>Tree-growth anomalies, fruit deformities, and natural growth structures all express hexagram-based geometry. The theory is further applied to the <b>human form</b>, where angular values of <b>joint movement</b> illustrate the underlying mathematical concepts.</p>

	<h3>Temporal Structure & Numerology</h3>
	
	<p>Calendar positions and selected historical dates (<b>May 25, June 28, August 1, October 28</b>) sit naturally within this fractional arithmetic. The text links symbolic numbers like <b>333 and 666</b> to precise force markers derived from its 365.25-based system.</p>
