**Short Synopsis:**  

Hexagram Force unites four books into a single framework aimed at solving fundamental scientific questions:

- Nog – Explores force as a structured phenomenon expressed through geometry, magnetism, and natural patterns. It studies ancient sites (Stonehenge, Easter Island, etc) as evidence of advanced knowledge of force distribution. This section also lays the groundwork for a unified field theory connecting gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear interactions.

- Quark – Demonstrates that planetary formation is not random but follows precise mathematical laws. Through repeated calculations, it shows correlations between tilt, size, and magnetic fields, offering proof of intentional design. It reexamines Einstein’s unfinished unified field theory, reveals hexagram configurations on gas giants, and connects astrological structures with planetary science.

- Rom – Challenges established constants, including reevaluating π as 3.15, and develops frameworks based on sacred geometry and biblical numerology. It interprets symbolic numbers such as 333 and 666 as force indicators, examines dark matter and dark energy, and highlights recurring constants such as 22.5° that appear across astronomy, ancient architecture, and natural cycles.

- Ishka – Extends the theory into human anatomy, showing that the body itself is constructed according to geometric laws and force principles. Joints and muscles all follow proportional systems described by various theories, proving that living systems embody the same universal structures as the cosmos.

Together, these volumes argue for a unified vision of force: one that redefines planetary science, offers solutions to the unified field theory and reveals a geometric order connecting the universe, the Earth, and the human body.
