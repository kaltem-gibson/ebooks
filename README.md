## About me, the Author
I, Kaltem M. Gibson, am a theoretical researcher and author specializing in the plane geometry of universal force, telekinesis, and EMF radiation. My groundbreaking work bridges the gap between mathematical structures and physical reality, uncovering the positional mechanics that govern everything from planetary motion to human potential. By challenging established paradigms, I provide a blueprint for understanding Force—whether it manifests through internal perception or within the structural architecture of the universe.

## Disclosure & Information Security Notice
The research contained in this archive—specifically the **Hexagram Force** series—represents groundbreaking advancements in Unified Field Theory. These findings expose the functional geometry of force that has remained obscured for generations.

**Notice on Information Suppression:** Please note that because this type of information is frequently removed or restricted on mainstream platforms, I recommend maintaining a personal archive. To ensure you have permanent access to these resources, I suggest downloading an offline copy for your records while the files remain available.

**Statement of Authenticity and Legal Notice:** Unauthorized and pirated copies of the **Telekinesis** research volume are currently circulating on secondary websites without my sanction. These illegitimate versions are not verified for accuracy and may contain altered or incomplete data. Please be advised that formal legal actions are currently being initiated to address these infringements. To ensure the integrity of the research and the safety of your data, only versions obtained directly from this archive or the official linked distributors are recognized as authentic.

## Research Categories & Publications

### I. The Force Series (Unified Field Theory)

* **Hexagram Force: Bridging Science, Metaphysics, and Numerology**

   My system is grounded in three original theories: the One-Third Theory, the Bi-Directional Doubling and Halving Theory, and the Zero-Exclusion Theory. These theories serve as the underlying logic used to explain and govern the **blueprint of force**, which consists of hexagram properties, magnetic properties, plane alignment, and degree distance.
   
   **Key Breakthroughs in this Volume:**
   * **A New Constant for Pi:** Establishes a precise value of 3.15 for pi, derived through plain geometry and hexagram symmetry.
   * **Mercury Rotation Precision:** Calculates Mercury’s rotation with an exceptional accuracy of 0.0003 degrees, proving the reliability of the geometric framework.
   * **Identifies Celestial & Terrestrial Alignments:** Connects planetary tilts, magnetic anomalies like the Bermuda Triangle, and ancient structures to a unified system of one-third degree increments.
   * **Tree Disc Anomalies:** This work demonstrates that physical irregularities—such as knots, defects, and burn marks—conform to hexagram properties. It illustrates that by examining a "disc" of a tree, these markers reveal a geometric order.

   *Please be advised that this is only a small part of what is taught in this particular book.*

* **Hexagram Force: Characteristics (Technical Ebook)**

   This work demonstrates how universal force cycles manifest through numerical patterns and force-triads on a 12-point clock. By analyzing geometric roles—Creative, Corrupt, Good, and Limitative—it reveals the structural alignment between universal laws and sequences like 333 and 666.

   * **Key Breakthroughs in Applied Universal Mechanics:** Analyzes the atmospheric stability of Saturn’s Hexagon and Earth’s 22.1° axial tilt relative to core force reference values.
	* **Advanced Factor Decomposition:** Breaks down complex values into micro-units to reveal the mathematical "hinges" connecting different cycle architectures.avior of force.
   * **Numerical/Geometric Mapping:** It teaches the methodology for overlaying numerical sequences onto physical structures, allowing for the prediction of where a force-anomaly (like a magnetic storm or a physical defect) is most likely to occur.

### II. Human Potential & Applied Energetics
* **Unleash Your Telekinetic Ability: The Three Fundamentals**

   A structural approach to mind-matter interaction and the mechanics of non-contact force application.

### III. Bio-Electrical & Environmental Research (Forthcoming)

* **EMF Radiation + Diabetes** 
   A critical investigation into the interaction between electromagnetic frequencies and biological glucose regulation. (Currently undergoing final editing; not yet online).
